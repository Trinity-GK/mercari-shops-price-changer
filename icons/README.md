# Icons

Place your extension icons in this directory with the following names and sizes:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon-32.png` - 32x32 pixels
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128 pixels

You can use any image editor or online tool to create these icons. Make sure they are PNG format with transparency support.

For now, you can use placeholder icons or create simple colored squares to test the extension.
